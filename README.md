# Effective Peel Learning for Small Data with Structured Features

Python implementation of Effective Peel Learning for Small Data with Structured Features.

## Installation

```python
python setup.py install
```
## Requirements

* Pytorch 0.4 or higher
* Python 3.6 or higher


## Usage

```python
python PL_train.py
```

## Data

In order to use our simulated data, this is the data description

* An P by P adjacent matrix binary (P is the number of features)
* An N by P feature matrix (N is the number of sample)

Have a look at the module\_x.py and module\_y.py to learn how the data is generated.
